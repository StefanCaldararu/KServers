\subsection{Outline}
\label{sec:out}
This paper considers the \KS problem, and the practical development of algorithms within a \CC environment. Additionally, we both provide a literature review, and multiple forms of analysis of a variety of algorithms. In sec.~\ref{sec:desc}, we provide a problem description for the \KS problem. In section~\ref{sec:background} a brief literature overview is provided, and then sec.~\ref{sec:AM} describes different performance metrics that can be used when looking at these algorithms. In section~\ref{sec:algDescription}, multiple popular \KS algorithms are described, and a brief list of benefits and drawbacks are provided. We then describe the software implementation for the algorithms in sec.~\ref{sec:implementationDetails}, and some analysis of numerical experiments in sec.~\ref{sec:numExperiments}. Finally, we provide some analysis of results in sec.~\ref{sec:analysis}, and propose future research thrusts in sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
