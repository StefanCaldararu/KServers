In this work, we analyze common algorithms and performance metrics for the \KS problem, and provide a practical application designed to analyze the algorithms described. Future work will consist of further simulation of larger inputs, and improvement upon program efficiency. The two largest things holding back the current application are computation power and memory usage. A program designed to function with finite memory for large input sets will be implemented. Additionally, GPU parallelism will be leveraged to provide further computational improvements. The algorithms provided will hopefully be able to run as batch jobs on a super computer, allowing for analysis of longer inputs. Finally, theoretical proofs for the observations described in sec.~\ref{sec:analysis} will be explored. This project will continue into an Honors Thesis, and results will be presented at the end of the 2024 Spring semester.
