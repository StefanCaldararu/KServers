In this work, we analyze the \KS problem and provide descriptions for various algorithms. We primarily focus on the most common form of analysis for the \KS problem, competitive analysis. We provide an overview of various theorems and proofs taken from~\cite{OnlineComp1998}, and additionally go over a fast min-cut max-flow formulation for computing the $\mathrm{WFA}$ movement~\cite{mcfp2011}. We then transition to focusing on the Unifying Potential~\cite{unifyingPotential2021}, overviewing a few of their definitions and proofs. We attempt to extend their methods for Multiray Spaces to Reduced Caterpillar Graphs. Finally, we describe various other analysis methods used in the context of this problem, and provide an open-source software framework for testing and comparing these algorithms. The software package can be found here: \url{https://github.com/StefanCaldararu/KServers}. We finally provide some experimental results derived using this software, and a brief description of these results.
