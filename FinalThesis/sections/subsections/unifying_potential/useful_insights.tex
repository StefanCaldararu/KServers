In this section, we provide a couple of useful insights that have been noted while looking at the unifying potential. Additionally, we go over a few of the proofs provided in~\cite{unifyingPotential2021}. 

\subsubsection*{$k=2$ is $k$ competitive}

Here, we follow the proof provided in the apendix of~\cite{unifyingPotential2021}.

\begin{lemma}
    For any work function $w$ with $k = 2$ and on any metric space, $\Phi(w) = \Phi_{x_1, r} (w)$, and therefore the WFA is 2 competitive.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    We will show that for any $x_1, x_2 \in M$, $\Phi_{x_1, x_2} (w) \geq min\{ \Phi_{x_1, r}, \Phi_{x_2, r}\}$, proving the lemma.
\end{proof}
