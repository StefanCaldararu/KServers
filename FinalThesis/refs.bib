abstract = {An on-line problem is one in which an algorithm must handle a sequence of requests, satisfying each request without knowledge of the future requests. Examples of on-line problems include scheduling the motion of elevators, finding routes in networks, allocating cache memory, and maintaining dynamic data structures. A competitive algorithm for an on-line problem has the property that its performance on any sequence of requests is within a constant factor of the performance of any other algorithm on the same sequence. This paper presents several general results concerning competitive algorithms, as well as results on specific on-line problems.},

abstract = {The k-server problem is that of planning the motion of k mobile servers on the vertices of a graph under a sequence of requests for service. Each request consists of the name of a vertex, and is satisfied by placing a server at the requested vertex. The requests must be satisfied in their order of occurrence. The cost of satisfying a sequence of requests is the distance moved by the servers. In this paper we study on-line algorithms for this problem from the competitive point of view. That is, we seek to develop on-line algorithms whose performance on any sequence of requests is as close as possible to the performance of the optimum off-line algorithm. We obtain optimally competitive algorithms for several important cases. Because of the flexibility in choosing the distances in the graph and the number of servers, the k-server problem can be used to model a number of important paging and caching problems. It can also be used as a building block for solving more general problems. We show how server algorithms can be used to solve a seemingly more general class of problems known as task systems.}

abstract = {In the k-server problem we wish to minimize, in an online fashion, the movement cost of k servers in response to a sequence of requests (we assume that k⩾2). The request issued at each step is specified by a point r in a given metric space M. To serve this request, one of the k servers must move to r. It is known that if M has at least k+1 points then no online algorithm for the k-server problem in M has competitive ratio smaller than k. The best known upper bound on the competitive ratio in arbitrary metric spaces, by Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou (J. ACM 42 (1995) 971), is 2k−1. There are only a few special cases for which k-competitive algorithms are known: for k=2, when M is a tree, or when M has at most k+2 points. We prove that the Work Function Algorithm is 3-competitive for the 3-server problem in the Manhattan plane. As a corollary, we obtain a 4.243-competitive algorithm for 3 servers in the Euclidean plane. The best previously known competitive ratio for 3 servers in these metric spaces was 5.}

The Harmonic algorithm is a very natural and simple randomized algorithm for the k-server problem. We give a simple proof that the Harmonic k-server algorithm is competitive. The competitive ratio we prove is the best currently known fo the algorithm. The Harmonic algorithm is memoryless and time-efficient. This is the only such algorithm known to be competitive for the k-server problem.},
